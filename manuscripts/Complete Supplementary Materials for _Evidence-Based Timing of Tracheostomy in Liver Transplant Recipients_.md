## Key Corrections Made

### CVVHD Definition Correction
**Original (Incorrect):** Chronic venous insufficiency  
**Corrected:** Continuous Veno-Venous Hemodialysis

This correction was applied throughout:
- Main manuscript text
- All supplementary tables
- Variable definitions
- Clinical interpretations

### Impact of Correction
The correction does not affect:
- Statistical analyses (variable coding unchanged)
- Cut-off values or scoring system
- Clinical recommendations
- Study conclusions

The correction only affects the clinical interpretation and understanding of this variable as a marker of renal replacement therapy rather than vascular disease.
